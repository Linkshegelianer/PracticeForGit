[SEE WHOLE LIST HERE](https://github.com/Linkshegelianer/java-algorithms-collections/blob/main/algorithms/ALGORITHMS.md)

# Big O notation
* **Time Complexity**: estimation of the number of operations or steps an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size.
* **Space Complexity**: maximum amount of auxiliary memory that an algorithm needs to allocate or use during its execution as a function of the input size.
  * **Auxiliary Space** is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

`n` in Time Complexity — the number of elements in the input.

`n` in Space Complexity — input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.

### Big-O Time Complexity Table
| Type | Name | Explanation | Status | Example |  
| ---- |------| ------|  ------| ------| 
| `O(1)` | Constant Time | Algorithm is executed the same number of times each time, regardless of the size of the input |  Excellent | Search in a hash table by key |  
| `O(log n)` | Logarithm Time | The execution time increases very slowly compared to the increase in the size of the input data | Excellent | Binary Search (Average) |  
| `O(n)` | Linear Time | The execution time is linearly proportional to the size of the input data | Good | Brute Force Search | 
| `O(n + k)` | Combined/Additive Time | Combined complexity of two separate inputs | Good | Counting Sort | 
| `O(n log n)` | Quasilinear Time | As the input size increases, the number of divisions required to solve the problem increases slowly due to the logarithmic growth | Bad | Merge Sort, Heap Sort |  
| `O(n^2)` | Quadratic Time | Involves nested iterations or comparisons for each element | Horrible | Selection Sort |  
| `O(2^n)` | Exponential Time | Involves exhaustive search or enumeration of all possible combinations of the input, execution time increases exponentially | Horrible | TSP (dynamic programming) | 
| `O(n!)` | Factorial Time | Involves exhaustive search or enumeration of all possible combinations of the input, execution time increases factorially | Horrible | TSP (brute force)

### Big-O Space Complexity Table
| Type | Name | Explanation | Status | Example |  
| ---- |------| ------|  ------| ------| 
| `O(1)` | Constant Space | Algorithm requires a fixed amount of additional memory, regardless of the input size |  Excellent | Heap Sort | 
| `O(log n)` | Logarithmic Space | The space usage increases slowly compared to the increase in the size of the input data | Excellent | Quick Sort | 
| `O(n)` | Linear Space | The space usage scales linearly with the input size | Good | Merge Sort |
| `O(n + k)` | Combined/Additive Space | The space usage scales linearly with the sum of `n` and `k` | Bad | Radix Sort |

### Definitions
| Term | Definition | Examples |  
| ---- |------| ------| 
| Abstract Data Type (ADT) | Represents a high-level description of a data type, focusing on its behavior and operations rather than the specific implementation details | stack, queue, dictionary, sequence, set |  
| Data Structure | Technique or strategy for implementing a particular data type, organizing and storing data in a specific way to facilitate efficient operations | array, linked list, hash table, trees (binary search tree, heap, red/black trees |
