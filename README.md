# Practice with Java 

A repository for algorithms and data structures in Java. I've created this repo to save solutions to questions I've found challenging and important for applying for a junior Java-dev role. I comment on some of the lines for my own understanding, but maybe you can also find these solutions useful. 

I'm not the full author for most of these solutions, but I try to keep them as efficient as possible. Most solutions can be compiled right away to check if they work correctly.

This was my first big GitHub-repo, so not only was I learning Java by adding one-two files every day after browsing Leetcode or Codewars, but also lear—Çing Git and its features. I use this repo as a way to keep track of my record and preserve motivation to solve tasks in Java daily.
